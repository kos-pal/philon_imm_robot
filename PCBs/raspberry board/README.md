This board connects to the Raspberry Pi with a 40pin connector. It also serves as the input for all the different power supplies of the robot (5V, 24V and 36V).
The board implements RS-485 for the UART communication between the modules with a SN75176B ic, 5V to 3.3V converters for the signals coming from the Arduino modules,a driving circuit for indication LEDs as well as an optocoupler monitoring the 36V rail power bus.
