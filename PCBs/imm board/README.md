This board connects to the Arduino nano that interfaces the robot with the injection molding machine. 
The board implements RS-485 for the UART communication between the modules with a SN75176B ic, 8 relay channels for outputing signals to the 
Euromap 12 plug and 7 optocoupler inputs for reading the signals from the Euromap 12 plug.
